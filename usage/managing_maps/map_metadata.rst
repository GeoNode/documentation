Maps Metadata
===============

In GeoNode special importance is given to *Metadata* and their standard formats.

Editing Metadata
---------------

| Metadata contains all the information related to the map. They provide essential information for its identification and its comprehension. Metadata also make the dataset more easily retrievable through search by other users.
| The *Metadata* of a map can be changed through a *Edit Metadata* form which involves four steps, one for each type of metadata considered:

You can open the *Metadata* form of a *Map* by clicking the :guilabel:`Edit Metadata` link from the :guilabel:`Edit` options on the *Map Page*.

      *Map Metadata form*

  In the first fields the system asks you to insert metadata including:

  * *Title* of the Map, which should be clear and understandable;
  * *Abstract*, brief narrative summary of the content of the map
  * *Date / Date type*
  * *Keywords*, which should be chosen within the available list. The contributor search for available keywords by clicking on the searching bar, or on the folder logo representing, or by entering the first letters of the desired word;
  * *Category* which the map belongs to;
  * *Keywords from Thesaurus*
  * *Keywords* which are simple keywords for the map


  Subsequently, more specialized metadata fields are presented in the metadata form:
