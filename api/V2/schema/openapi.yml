        Update one or more model instances.

        If ENABLE_BULK_UPDATE is set, multiple previously-fetched records
        may be updated in a single call, provided their IDs.

        If ENABLE_PATCH_ALL is set, multiple records
        may be updated in a single PATCH call, even without knowing their IDs.

        *WARNING*: ENABLE_PATCH_ALL should be considered an advanced feature
        and used with caution. This feature must be enabled at the viewset level
        and must also be requested explicitly by the client
        via the "patch-all" query parameter.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

            true (or 1): records will be fetched and then updated in a transaction loop
              - The `Model.save` method will be called and model signals will run
              - This can be slow if there are too many signals or many records in the query
              - This is considered the more safe and default behavior
            query: records will be updated in a single query
              - The `QuerySet.update` method will be called and model signals will not run
              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},

                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true

        Update one or more model instances.

        If ENABLE_BULK_UPDATE is set, multiple previously-fetched records
        may be updated in a single call, provided their IDs.

        If ENABLE_PATCH_ALL is set, multiple records
        may be updated in a single PATCH call, even without knowing their IDs.

        *WARNING*: ENABLE_PATCH_ALL should be considered an advanced feature
        and used with caution. This feature must be enabled at the viewset level
        and must also be requested explicitly by the client
        via the "patch-all" query parameter.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

            true (or 1): records will be fetched and then updated in a transaction loop
              - The `Model.save` method will be called and model signals will run
              - This can be slow if there are too many signals or many records in the query
              - This is considered the more safe and default behavior
            query: records will be updated in a single query
              - The `QuerySet.update` method will be called and model signals will not run
              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},
                {'id': 2, 'fur': 'black'},
                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true
            {
                'fur': 'gold'

        Update one or more model instances.

        If ENABLE_BULK_UPDATE is set, multiple previously-fetched records
        may be updated in a single call, provided their IDs.

        If ENABLE_PATCH_ALL is set, multiple records
        may be updated in a single PATCH call, even without knowing their IDs.

        *WARNING*: ENABLE_PATCH_ALL should be considered an advanced feature
        and used with caution. This feature must be enabled at the viewset level
        and must also be requested explicitly by the client
        via the "patch-all" query parameter.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

            true (or 1): records will be fetched and then updated in a transaction loop
              - The `Model.save` method will be called and model signals will run
              - This can be slow if there are too many signals or many records in the query
              - This is considered the more safe and default behavior
            query: records will be updated in a single query
              - The `QuerySet.update` method will be called and model signals will not run
              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},
                {'id': 2, 'fur': 'black'},
                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true

        Update one or more model instances.

        If ENABLE_BULK_UPDATE is set, multiple previously-fetched records
        may be updated in a single call, provided their IDs.

        If ENABLE_PATCH_ALL is set, multiple records
        may be updated in a single PATCH call, even without knowing their IDs.

        *WARNING*: ENABLE_PATCH_ALL should be considered an advanced feature
        and used with caution. This feature must be enabled at the viewset level
        and must also be requested explicitly by the client
        via the "patch-all" query parameter.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

            true (or 1): records will be fetched and then updated in a transaction loop
              - The `Model.save` method will be called and model signals will run
              - This can be slow if there are too many signals or many records in the query
              - This is considered the more safe and default behavior
            query: records will be updated in a single query
              - The `QuerySet.update` method will be called and model signals will not run
              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},
                {'id': 2, 'fur': 'black'},
                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true
            {
                'fur': 'gold'

        Update one or more model instances.

        If ENABLE_BULK_UPDATE is set, multiple previously-fetched records
        may be updated in a single call, provided their IDs.

        If ENABLE_PATCH_ALL is set, multiple records
        may be updated in a single PATCH call, even without knowing their IDs.

        *WARNING*: ENABLE_PATCH_ALL should be considered an advanced feature
        and used with caution. This feature must be enabled at the viewset level
        and must also be requested explicitly by the client
        via the "patch-all" query parameter.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

            true (or 1): records will be fetched and then updated in a transaction loop
              - The `Model.save` method will be called and model signals will run
              - This can be slow if there are too many signals or many records in the query
              - This is considered the more safe and default behavior
            query: records will be updated in a single query
              - The `QuerySet.update` method will be called and model signals will not run
              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},
                {'id': 2, 'fur': 'black'},
                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true
            {
                'fur': 'gold'

        Update one or more model instances.

        If ENABLE_BULK_UPDATE is set, multiple previously-fetched records
        may be updated in a single call, provided their IDs.

        If ENABLE_PATCH_ALL is set, multiple records
        may be updated in a single PATCH call, even without knowing their IDs.

        *WARNING*: ENABLE_PATCH_ALL should be considered an advanced feature
        and used with caution. This feature must be enabled at the viewset level
        and must also be requested explicitly by the client
        via the "patch-all" query parameter.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

            true (or 1): records will be fetched and then updated in a transaction loop
              - The `Model.save` method will be called and model signals will run
              - This can be slow if there are too many signals or many records in the query
              - This is considered the more safe and default behavior
            query: records will be updated in a single query
              - The `QuerySet.update` method will be called and model signals will not run
              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},
                {'id': 2, 'fur': 'black'},
                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true
            {
                'fur': 'gold'

              - This will be fast, but may break data constraints that are controlled by signals
              - This is considered unsafe but useful in certain situations

        The server's successful response to a patch-all request
        will NOT include any individual records. Instead, the response content will contain
        a "meta" object with an "updated" count of updated records.

        Examples:

        Update one dog:

            PATCH /dogs/1/
            {
                'fur': 'white'
            }

        Update many dogs by ID:

            PATCH /dogs/
            [
                {'id': 1, 'fur': 'white'},
                {'id': 2, 'fur': 'black'},
                {'id': 3, 'fur': 'yellow'}
            ]

        Update all dogs in a query:

            PATCH /dogs/?filter{fur.contains}=brown&patch-all=true
            {
                'fur': 'gold'
