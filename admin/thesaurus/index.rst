Thesauri
========

Introduction
------------

A **thesaurus** is a structured vocabulary used to manage and standardize keywords (also known as tags) that describe resources. It helps improve metadata quality, searchability, and interoperability by enforcing controlled vocabularies.

Key Functions
-------------

Controlled Vocabulary
   Instead of free-text keywords, thesauri offer predefined and **standardized terms** organized thematically (e.g., ISO 19115 topics, GEMET, INSPIRE themes).

Semantic Consistency  
   Users tagging datasets can choose from a consistent list of terms, **reducing redundancy** and ambiguity (e.g., avoiding both "roads" and "road" as separate tags).

Improved search and filtering
   Thesauri enable structured tagging of datasets, allowing more accurate searches and the use of **faceted filters** to easily narrow down results.

Localization
    Each concept in a thesaurus can have **translations for different languages**, allowing localized display based on the userâ€™s interface language.

Metadata Standards Integration  
   Thesauri can align with **international standards** (like ISO, INSPIRE, GEMET), which is especially important when GeoNode is used in institutional or governmental contexts.


Data model
----------

The *GeoNode thesaurus model* is designed to support multilingual, structured vocabularies. It consists of the following key components:

Thesaurus: 
    * Represents a full controlled vocabulary (e.g., GEMET, INSPIRE themes). 
    * In SKOS terms, it's a ``skos:ConceptScheme``.

ThesaurusLabel:
    * Stores the localized names (titles/descriptions) of a thesaurus for different languages. 
    * In SKOS terms, it's a ``skos:preflabel`` within the ``skos:ConceptScheme``.

ThesaurusKeyword: 
    * Represents a single concept or term within a thesaurus (e.g., "Land Cover", "Transport"), also storing the default label (used where the translation for a given requested language is not defined) and its identifying URI. 
    * In SKOS terms, it's a ``skos:Concept``.

ThesaurusKeywordLabel:
     * Stores the multilingual labels for each keyword. 
     * In SKOS terms, it's a ``skos:preflabel`` within the ``skos:Concept``.

Adding a Thesaurus
==================

A thesaurus can be added in Geonode by:

* creating a new thesaurus instance within the GeoNode admin pages.
  As a minumum, you need to:

  * add a thesaurus in admin / base / Thesaurus
  * add one or more instances of Keywords in admin / base / ThesaurusKeywords
* uploading a RDF file (either xml, ttl, jsonld or any other format recognized by `RDFlib <https://rdflib.dev/>`__).
  When uploading a file, the behaviour is the same as running the command ``thesaurus load --action update`` (see :ref:`load_thesaurus`)
* loading a RDF file using the `thesaurus load` management command (see :ref:`load_thesaurus`).


Upload an RDF file via the thesaurus admin page
-----------------------------------------------

Navigate to the thesaurus page in the admin panel ``http://<your_geonode_host>/admin/base/thesaurus``.  
On the top-right of the page a button named :guilabel:`Upload thesaurus` will be available:

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_admin_1.png
     :align: center

After clicking on it, a simple form for the upload will be shown which will allow you to select your desired RDF file:

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_admin_2.png
     :align: center

By clicking on `Upload RDF`, the system will load the thesaurus and assign it a "slugified" name based on the file name.
The name can be easily changed later in the edit page.

If everything goes fine, a success message will be shown:

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_admin_success.png
     :align: center

Otherwise the UI will show the error message:

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_admin_fail.png
     :align: center



Management commands
===================

GeoNode provides a single command (``thesaurus``) with multiple actions: 

* ``list``: list existing thesauri
* ``load``: load a RDF file
* ``dump``: dump a thesaurus into a file

.. code-block:: 

    python manage.py thesaurus --help

List thesauri: ``thesaurus list``
---------------------------------

Get a list of the thesauri in GeoNode.  

Useful to find out the id of the thesauri when you need to export one of them.


.. _load_thesaurus:

Importing a thesaurus: ``thesaurus load``
-----------------------------------------

The ``load`` command may create an entire Thesaurus, or just update part of it.

Allowed params:

* ``file``: file to load; required
* ``action``: ``create``, ``update``, ``append``, ``parse``; optional, default ``create``;
* ``identifier``: the id of the thesaurus; optional, defaults to a name created using the filename.

The **automatic identifier creation** skips all the chars after the first dot in order to allow a thesaurus partitioning.

For instance we may have different rdf files containing the labels for multiple projects, e.g.: ``labels-i18n.proj1.rdf``, ``labels-i18n.proj2.rdf``... We may simply loop on the filenames and run the ``load`` subcommand on each of them, and all the keywords will be added to the same Thesaurus having id ``labels-i18n``.

The ``load`` command has different behaviours according to the ``action`` parameter:

Actions:

* ``parse``: 
    parse the file and loop on all the concepts without writng anything in the db. Is equivalent to the classic ``dryrun`` option;
* ``create`` (default action): 
    tries and create a thesaurus. If the thesaurus already exists, raises an exception.
* ``append``: 
     creates entries if they do not exist; pk are the ones listed in update action.
     If the entry already exists, it is not changed in any way.    
* ``update``: 
    creates and updates entries:

    * *Thesaurus*: creates it if it doesn't exist, pk is "identifier".
      If it exists updates "date", "description", "title", "about"
    * *ThesaurusLabel*: creates it if it doesn't exist, pk is "thesaurus", "lang"
      If it exists updates "value"
    * *ThesaurusKeyword*: creates it if it doesn't exist, pk is "thesaurus", "about"
      If it exists updates "alt_label"
    * *ThesaurusKeywordlabel*: creates it if it doesn't exist, pk is "thesauruskeyword", "lang"
      If it exists updates "label"


.. _dump_thesaurus:

Exporting a thesaurus: ``thesaurus dump``
-----------------------------------------

The ``dump`` command may export an entire Thesaurus or just a part of it.


Allowed params:

- ``identifier``: the id of the thesaurus; required.
- ``include``: Optional; filter ThesaurusKeywords to be dumped. Can be repeated. Filtering is applied on the `about` field. Filters are in the format either `*string` or `string*`
- ``exclude``: Optional; like `include` but filter out ThesaurusKeywords from being dumped.
- ``format``: optional, RDF format for the output (``json-ld``, ``n3``, ``nt``, ``pretty-xml``, ``sorted-xml``, ``trig``, ``ttl``, ``xml``). Default ``sorted-xml``
- ``default-lang``: Default language code for untagged string literals; default is from ``settings.THESAURUS_DEFAULT_LANG``
- ``out``: Full path to the output file to be created. Optional; if omitted the RDF content is sent to stderr.


Format
^^^^^^

All the formats, except for ``sorted-xml``, use the *RDFlib* library to serialize the thesaurus data. Since RDFlib handles the concepts as a graph, there is no ordering in the output data. This means that two consecutive ``dump`` of the same thesaurus may create two different files. 

When importing and exporting thesauri as a file, it may be useful to perform diff on them to find out what has changed.
The format ``sorted-xml`` creates a predictable output, where the ConceptScheme is at the start of the file, and the Concepts are sorted by their ``about`` field. Furthermore, the ``prefLabel``'s are sorted by their ``lang`` attribute.


Partial export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``dump`` command also allows to export a subset of the keywords (concepts) in a Thesaurus.

As an example, let's say we have the ``labels-i18n`` thesaurus, which contains some GeoNode official labels.

In our project we added some keywords prefixed with "proj1_", since they belong to project1. 

Also in our GeoNode instance, we added some labels which override the standard ones, and are postfixed with ``_ovr``. 

In order to only export the entries we edited, we'll issue the command::

    python manage.py thesaurus dump -i labels-i18n --include "proj1_*" --include "*_ovr" -f labels-i18n.proj1.rdf


Configuring a Thesaurus
=======================

After a thesaurus is loaded o created in GeoNode, it should be configured in the :guilabel:`Admin` panel.

The panel can be reached from :guilabel:`Admin` link of the *User Menu* in the navigation bar or through this URL: ``http://<your_geonode_host>/admin/base/thesaurus``.

Once you are on the Thesaurus lists, select one thesaurus to open the Edit page

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_edit_page.png
     :align: center

     *The GeoNode Thesaurus edit Interface*

These are the thesaurus main attributes:

- ``identifier``: (mandatory) the thesaurus identifier (set by the ``--identifier``  parameter in the ``thesaurus load`` command, or automatically generated using the file name).
- ``title``: (mandatory) The default title of the thesaurus (may be set from the loaded RDF file).
- ``date``: (mandatory) The Date of the thesaurus (may be set from the loaded RDF file).
- ``description``: (mandatory) The description of the thesaurus (may be set from the loaded RDF file).
- ``slug``: (deprecated, use ``identifier`` instead) The slug of the thesaurus.
- ``about``: (optional) The ``rdf:about`` URI of the thesaurus  (may be set from the loaded RDF file).

Next attributes define **how the thesaurus shall be used** within GeoNode.

- ``card min``: (optional) The minimum cardinality, default = 0
- ``card max``: (optional) The maximum cardinality, default = -1 (no limit)
- ``facet``: (boolean) Decide if the thesaurus will be shown in the facet list, default: True -- To be set to `true` only when ``card_max != 0``
- ``order``: (integer) Set the listing order of the thesaurus in the facet list and in the metadata editor, default: 0, asc order from 0 to N

If ``card max`` is not zero, the metadata editor will automatically display the Thesaurus in the list of the controlled terms. 
More precisely these are the cases according to the two cardinality fields:

- `card_max=0` --> Disabled, The Thesaurus will not appear in the GUI
- `card_max=1` & `card_min = 0` --> Single choice, optional.
- `card_max=1` & `card_min = 1` --> Single choice, required
- `card_max=-1` & `card_min = 0`  --> [0..N] Multiple choices, optional
- `card_max=-1` & `card_min = 1` --> [1..N] Multiple choices, required

The metadata editor will show all the thesauri with ``card_max != 0``, each one with its own title, like in the following image:


.. figure:: img/thesaurus_choices.png
     :align: center

     *The metadata interface with the Thesaurus enabled*


The Thesauri having ``card_max == 0`` are used as **codelists**: it means that they will be referred within GeoNode via their identifier for specific purposes. There will be ad-hoc documentation for each of such codelists.

For instance, the thesaurus with identifier ``labels-i18n`` is used for the metadata labels translations.


Using keywords from a thesaurus
===============================

After you've finished the setup you should find a new input widget in the metadata editor allowing you to choose keywords from the thesaurus for your resource.

Also, if you set the ``facet`` attribute to ``true``,  the thesaurus should be listed in the filter section in GeoNode's resource list views.

For instance, if we have these thesauri:

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_admin_list.png
     :align: center
     :width: 450px

     *List of configured sample thesauri*


both set with ``card max != 0`` and ``facet = true``, we'll have in the editor:

.. figure:: img/thesaurus_edit_sample.png
     :align: center
     :width: 450px

     *Keyword selectors for sample thesauri*

and we'll also have them in the filtering panel as facets:

     :align: center

     *Facets selectors for sample thesauri*
