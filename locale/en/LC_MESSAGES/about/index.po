"GeoNode is a geospatial content management system, a platform for the "
"management and publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature "
"and stable open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-"
"use interface allowing non-specialized users to share data and create "
"interactive maps."

"Data management tools built into GeoNode allow for integrated creation of"
" data, metadata, and map visualization. Each dataset in the system can be"
" shared publicly or restricted to allow access to only specific users. "

"allow for the development of communities around each platform to "
"facilitate the use, management, and quality control of the data the "
"GeoNode instance contains."
