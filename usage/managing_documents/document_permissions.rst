Through the *Share* Link shown in the menu it is possible to manage the document share options. it opens a form where set up who can:

* None (the document is not visible).
* View Metadata  (allows to view the document).
* View and Download (allows to view and download the document).
* Edit (allows to change the document metadata and attributes).
* Manage it (allows to update, delete, change share options, publish/unpublish).
