# Dashboard

Dashboard is a MapStore tool integrated in GeoNode that provides the user with a space to add many Widgets, such as charts, maps, tables, texts and counters, and can create connections between them in order to:

-   Provide an overview to better visualize a specific data context
-   Interact spatially and analytically with the data by creating connections between widgets
-   Perform analysis on involved data/layers

To build a new Dashboard go to `Add Resource`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option on the *All Resources* page and choose option *Create dashboard* or select `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option on the *Dashboards* page
