Advanced Dataset Management with MapStore
=======================================
:::

GeoNode provides the user with some advanced features for dataset manipulation such as dataset filtering, attribute edition and dataset export in different formats.
In a nutshell, these feature are provided via MapStore and we will redirect the user to MapStore specific documentation for further details.

Filtering Datasets

With GeoNode you can filter a dataset via it\'s attributes, direct map filter by drawing an area of interest over the map canvas and via cross-dataset filter, allowing intersection, contained and contains overlay methods.
For more detail please check the MapStore documentation [here](https://mapstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/filtering-layers/).
