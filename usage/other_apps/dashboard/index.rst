Dashboard
========

Dashboard is a MapStore tool integrated in GeoNode that provides the user with a space to add many Widgets, such as charts, maps, tables, texts and counters, and can create connections between them in order to:

* Provide an overview to better visualize a specific data context
* Interact spatially and analytically with the data by creating connections between widgets
* Perform analysis on involved data/layers

To build a new Dashboard go to :guilabel:`Create new` option on the resource page and choose option *Create dashboard*.
