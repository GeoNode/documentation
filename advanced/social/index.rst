Allow GeoNode to Login throguh Social Accounts (OIDC)
-----------------------------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Through the so-called "social accounts," GeoNode allows authentication through external providers that support the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol, such as Google and Microsoft Azure.

 How does it work? Once the authentication provider is configured, GeoNode's sign-on will display a new login button that redirects the user to the external authentication page. After successfully authenticating with the external provider and accepting privacy consents, the browser will redirect the user back to the GeoNode page, prompting them to enter any missing information the first time and automatically authenticating them on subsequent occasions.


Usage
~~~~~

 Once the provider has been correctly configured (see below), GeoNode will allow the user to login through it.

 The first time you login you will probably need to confirm you `e-mail` and other fields of the `profile`.

 .. note::

     If you want a user to be automatically signed as a member of a group, you will need to:

      1. Create the `GroupProfile` in GeoNode
      2. Provide the `groups` or `roles` the user belongs to throguh the `id_token` or `user_info` metadata from the `OIDC` provider itself.

    Notice that, in the case you would like to benefit from this functionality:

      1. Every time the user sing-in again, the groups will be automatically re-assigned by GeoNode, and therefore it won't be possible to assign them manually anymore.
      2. If you need a user to be recognized as a `manager` of the `groups` declared from the provider, you will need to send a claim `is_manager: True` on the user info metadata.

Quick Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Currently GeoNode comes with two predefined configurations that you can use to enable either Google or Microsoft Azure.

 **Google**

 1. Add to your `.env` the following settings

    .. code-block:: shell
        
        SOCIALACCOUNT_OIDC_PROVIDER_ENABLED=True
        SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDER=google


 2. Login into GeoNode as an `admin`, go to the `Social Account` settings, create a new `geonode_openid_connect` provider and insert the

    .. code-block:: shell
        
        Client ID
        Client Secret

 **Microsoft Azure**

 1. Add to your `.env` the following settings

    .. code-block:: shell
        
        MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=<the_tenant_id>
        SOCIALACCOUNT_OIDC_PROVIDER_ENABLED=True
        SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDER=azure

 2. Login into GeoNode as an `admin`, go to the `Social Account` settings, create a new `geonode_openid_connect` provider and insert the

    .. code-block:: shell
        
        Client ID
        Client Secret

Advanced Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In the case you need to change the default behavior of GeoNode or add a new/custom OIDC provider, you will need to update the `settings` manually as follows.

 .. code-block:: python

    SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
        SOCIALACCOUNT_OIDC_PROVIDER: {
            "NAME": "Your Custom Provider",
            "SCOPE": [
                # Custom scopes comma-separated
            ],
            "AUTH_PARAMS": {
                # Custom AUTH PARAMS
            },
            "COMMON_FIELDS": {"email": "email", "last_name": "family_name", "first_name": "given_name"},  # Custom common fields mappings
            "IS_MANAGER_FIELD": "the_custom_manager_claim",  # This is optional
            "ACCOUNT_CLASS": "the_custom_account_class",
            "ACCESS_TOKEN_URL": "the_custom_token_uri",
            "AUTHORIZE_URL": "the_custom_auth_uri",
            "ID_TOKEN_ISSUER": "the_custom_uri",  # or "PROFILE_URL": "the_custom_user_info_uri"; if you specify the "ID_TOKEN_ISSUER" this will take precedence
            "OAUTH_PKCE_ENABLED": True,
        }
    }

 .. note::

    If you specify the "ID_TOKEN_ISSUER" this will take precedence trying to fetch the user info metadata from the `id_token`.

    If the `id_token` won't be available, it will try to fallback to the "PROFILE_URL" uri.

 In the case you will need to customzie how the `Adapter` works and manages the `Groups` registration, you can inject a new class throguh the settings:

  .. code:: shell

        SOCIALACCOUNT_ADAPTER="geonode.people.adapters.GenericOpenIDConnectAdapter"  # This is the default value
