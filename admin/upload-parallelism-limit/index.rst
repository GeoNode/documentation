Default: ``5``

When `uploading datasets <../../usage/managing_datasets/uploading_datasets.html#datasets-uploading>`__, this value limits the number os parallel uploads.

You will get the following message in case of error: ``The number of active parallel uploads exceeds 5. Wait for the pending ones to finish.``

This means that you to finish current active uploads before creating a new one.
The default maximum number is set during installation by `DEFAULT_MAX_PARALLEL_UPLOADS_PER_USER <../../basic/settings/index.html#default-max-parallel-uploads-per-user>`__, usually 5 parallel uploads.

After installation, only an user with administrative rights can change it by the admin painel or `accessing by api <../../devel/api/V2/index.html#get--api-v2-upload-parallelism-limits->`__.
