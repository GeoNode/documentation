msgid "Your GeoNode project is based on core components which are interoperable and as such, it is straightforward for you to integrate with external applications and services. This section will walk you through how to connect to your GeoNode instance from other applications and how to integrate other services into your GeoNode project. When complete, you should have a good idea about the possibilities for integration, and have basic knowledge about how to accomplish it. You may find it necessary to dive deeper into how to do more complex integration in order to accomplish your goals, but you should feel comfortable with the basics, and feel confident reaching out to the wider GeoNode community for help."
